# miRNA Expression Correlation Analysis and Heatmap Visualization
This project aims to analyze and visualize miRNA (microRNA) expression correlations across various cancer types using R programming.
The data was processed to remove the NAs and then the correlation matrix was calculated between every pair of cancers. 
There are two correlation matrices and two heatmaps. 
A pearson cor-relation was also computed between the two matrices and a heatmap was plotted for the respective matrix.
